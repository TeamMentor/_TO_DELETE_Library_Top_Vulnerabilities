Set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags on all sensitive cookies, including session cookies.

==Why==

Set the //Secure// flag on all sensitive cookies to protect the contents of the sensitive cookies from eavesdropping attacks. Setting the //Secure// flag on sensitive cookies ensures they are only transferred over connections that are secured by SSL. 

Set the //HTTPOnly// flag on sensitive cookies to prevent the contents of those cookies from being access by Cross-Site Scripting exploits. The //HTTPOnly// flag prevents the contents of the marked cookie from being accessed by client-side script.

==How==

To set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags on all sensitive cookies:

# **Verify that SSL is available.** The //Secure// flag forces cookies to be sent over SSL. SSL has to be available for this to work.
# **Identify sensitive cookies.** Session cookies should always be considered sensitive. Enumerate all cookies used by the application. Make a list of cookies that may contain sensitive information.
# **Identify code that creates sensitive cookies.** For each sensitive cookie in the list, find the code that creates that cookie.
# **Set the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for each sensitive cookie.** For each piece of code that creates a sensitive cookie, add code that sets the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for the cookie. Make sure, that when the //Secure// attribute is set for a cookie, it is in response to a request that was made over HTTPS and not HTTP.
# **Configure the platform.** Many platform have configuration options that allow setting the //Secure// and //HTTPOnly// flags for session cookies. Please refer to your platform's documentation for information about whether this functionality is available and how to use it.</div>]]></Data>
